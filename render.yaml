# Render Deployment Configuration

# This file helps Render understand how to deploy your app

## Build Configuration
- Python version: 3.9+
- Build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Start command: `gunicorn --worker-class eventlet -w 1 app:app`

## Environment Variables
Set these in your Render dashboard:

### Required
- `SECRET_KEY`: A secure random string for Flask sessions
- `FLASK_ENV`: Set to "production" for live deployment

### Optional
- `DATABASE_URL`: SQLite database path (auto-managed)
- `PORT`: Port number (auto-managed by Render)

## Database
- SQLite database is automatically created on first run
- Data persists across deployments
- No external database service required

## Scaling
- Recommended: Single worker due to SQLite limitations
- For high traffic, consider upgrading to PostgreSQL

## Health Check
- Endpoint: `/` (main dashboard)
- Expected response: 200 OK

## Static Files
- CSS and JS files served from `/static/`
- Bootstrap and FontAwesome loaded from CDN
- Optimized for fast loading

## WebSocket Support
- Real-time features powered by Socket.IO
- Automatic fallback to polling if WebSockets unavailable
- Optimized for Render's networking

## Security
- HTTPS automatically provided by Render
- Environment variables for sensitive data
